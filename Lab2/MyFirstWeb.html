    <h1>Guide on Installing Laravel</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Meet Laravel</h3>
                    <p>Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Why Laravel?</h3>
                    <p>There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>A Progressive Framework</h4>
                            <p>We like to call Laravel a progressive framework. By that, we mean that Laravel grows with you.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>A Scalable Framework</h4>
                            <p>Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and Laravelâ€™s built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Your First Laravel Project</h3>
                    <p>Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Laravel &amp; Docker</h3>

                            <h4>Getting Started On macOS</h4>
                            <p>If you are developing on a Mac and Docker Desktop is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Getting Started On Windows</h4>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Getting Started On Linux</h4>
                            <p>If you are developing on Linux and Docker Compose is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Choosing Your Sail Services</h4>
                            <p>When creating a new Laravel application via Sail, you may use the <code>--with</code> query string variable to choose which services should be configured in your new application's <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.</p>
                        </li>
